The files in this directory support the SBIG cameras. Installation of SBIG driver (libsbigudrv.so) is required.

Installing the SBGIG driver:

Copy the SBIG driver (libsbigudrv.so) to /usr/local/lib.Drivers for ARM, 32-bit and 64 bit Intel processors are in the 
directory SBIG_dev.

Now copy 51-sbig-debian.rules into /etc/udev/rules.d  (the rules file is also in the SBIG_Dev directory)

And lastly, point LD_LIBRARY_PATH to /usr/local/lib
