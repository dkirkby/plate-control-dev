"""EMAIL FROM STEVE ON STARTING POINT FOR INSTRUMENT PARAMETERS CONFIG FILE
All,

Here is a sample configuration file for an "instrument".  Let us call the instrument "em" for engineering model (or whatever you want).
Pound sign (#) is a comment line.  Blank lines are OK.  I will need to write up the meaning of fvcrot, fvcxoff, fvcyoff, and fvcflip, since the operations are not commutative.  None of the parameters is mandatory.

Steve

File is called em.par

#First 3 parameters are appropriate for protoDESI FLI camera.
fvcnrow 6000
fvcncol 6000
fvcpixmm .006

#Scale and orientation of FVC camera - these are appropriate for protoDESI
#fvcmag is demagnification from focal plane to FVC ccd.
fvcmag 21.842
fvcrot  0.
fvcxoff 0.
fvcyoff 0.
fvcflip 1

#Flat or aspheric focal plane?
asphere 1

"""COMMENTS FROM ERIC ON FORMAT OF FIDUCIALS DATA FILE FOR PLATEMAKER
PER EMAIL 2017-02-10, THIS STUFF DOES GO INTO THE .par INSTRUMENT FILE

Internally to Steve, itâ€™s the same format as the files he uses for positioners and positioner_calib. There is an example in $PLATEMAKER_DIR/test/data/testinst1/fiducial-testinst1.dat, which is just a copy of the defualt file in dervishtools, trunk/desi/etc/default/fiducial-default.dat.

It looks like this:
