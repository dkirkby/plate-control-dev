# Template for general settings for fiber positioner.
# These are values which are usually not specific to a given hardware unit.
# However the system is flexible such that if a particular unit (or set of units) needs a unique settings file, then that is no problem.
# The main reason to separate out these particular values here is for consistent and comparable sets of settings across physical tests of multiple hardware units.

PRINCIPLE_HARDSTOP_DIR_T         =    -1  # int, +1, -1, or 0. +1 means use hardstop at max of theta range, -1 means use hardstop at min of range, 0 means no hardstop exists
